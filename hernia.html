			Biodegradable Hernia Repair

<p>Hernias are typically repaired with plastic fabrics that work well in many cases, but are not suitable for implantation in an infected surgical site.  This is because the non-degradable plastics meshes can harbor expanding bacterial infection.  In this project, we sought to develop a strong but degradable hernia patch by adapting materials we developed for <a class='other-references' href='cardio.html'>cardiovascular tissue replacement</a> (fig. 1).<p>

<p>We studied these patches in a rat hernia repair model.  This investigation showed that the patches prevented re-herniation and gradually degraded as natural tissue infiltrated the artificial material.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>We also developed a laser-machining strategy for including stem cells in collagen patches to accelerate tissue ingrowth, and received a grant from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute to study these materials.  We showed that the addition of stem cells to these patches increased their strength of integration with native tissue, and increased the formation of a vascular network in the implanted patches (fig. 2).<sup>2</sup></p>  

<p>In principle, both these findings should enhance the performance of the patches in infected wound sites.<p>
