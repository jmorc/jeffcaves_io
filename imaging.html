<p>Ablation procedures are effective in treating atrial fibrillation, the rapid and spasmatic contraction of the upper chambers of the heart.  In these procedures, cardiologists use minimally invasive catheter tools to apply controlled electrical burns (ablations) to the heart wall.  By ablating the tissue, the erratic electrical signals that cause fibrillation can be blocked. In some cases, cardiologists need to do a second procedure to burn areas of tissue that were missed the first time.  However, it is very difficult to visually distinguish areas of the tissue have been previously ablated from healthy tissue.</p>

<p>After studying this issue, I initiated a collaboration between cardiology and imaging experts at Stanford.  We conducted in vitro experiments, in which we ablated pieces of heart tissue and used fluorescent and multi-spectral imaging to visualize the ablations (fig. 1).  We defined the optimal parameters for imaging the ablations and obtained a patent for a device and method to visualize heart tissue (<a href='https://patents.google.com/patent/US9907471B2' class='other-references'>US9907471B2</a>).  Stanford is currently seeking commercial partners to develop this technology.</p>
